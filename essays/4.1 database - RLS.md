# RLS

RLS promises that user can select/insert/update/delete only their records.
when not using RLS, we need to be conscious who can update what.

for example: - user_id could come from frontend. ☢️

It could be easy to make that mistake here - https://github.com/xerosanyam/remfo/blob/ad696c589e1697605b4ac8072a0c806e5b12dd10/src/routes/(protected)/home/%2Bpage.server.ts

## Steps

1.  Don't use user `postgres` - it bypasses all RLS
2.  by default use `authenticator`, when authenticated use `authenticated`- same concept used by postgREST
