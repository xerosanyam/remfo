1. Control your future
   We don't want to chase the hype.

2. Chase to learn fundamentals

3. Use abstractions, mindfully

4. Timeless

- We want the product to feel fresh.
- we want to have minimal changes in look & feel

5. Straightforward

- we don't want flashy landing pages
- we use right tools for the job (google slides for animation and showing value of product)
- we value human time (don't want to spend time ironing landing pages)
