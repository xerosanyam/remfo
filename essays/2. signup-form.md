# Signup form

We want control over how it should look. We don't want any additional dependency, so we built vanilla forms. They work nicely with sveltekit's form actions. They also work perfectly with zod and constraints.

With zod, our validation logic stays at a single place where it should be - backend.
No need to add maxLength to frontend code manually, zod & superforms take care of this.

I don't feel there is a simpler way to achieve what we have so far.

## extra things to do with use:enhance

- show loading states;
  - without use:enhance, browser takes care of this; a spinner shows up in tab
  - we avoided this by not waiting for it to save. if it doesn't save within 1s it fails. ui feels snappy. can't get snappier than this? :)
