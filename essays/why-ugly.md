# Why does the project look ugly?

As milestone 0.1 we decided that we won't have

1. Any styles (css)
2. Any JS on frontend

we want the Project to work e2e.

This is because we want to _focus_ on core product.
Make it usable, go deeper. Add important actions. add keyboard shortcuts(maybe).

Its like we are designing the engine.. once it is fine-tuned, then we will work on look and feel.

also, did you notice that app works without JS?
