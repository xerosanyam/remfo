# Which stack

I played around with nextjs, nuxt, htmx.
Svelte was the only framework, that let me buid web apps that could work without any js. [why is it important](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-still-important/).
I also did a perf test and found sveltekit great out of the box.

## HTMX

HTMX requires JS.
Our app will be interactive. For that need, HTMX doesn't look self sufficent. It requires alpine/likes.

## Nextjs

Nextjs requires writing lot of code.

## sveltekit

- Less code implies less bug + move faster.
- makes use of browser
- no need to write js for simple things (submitting data to server)
