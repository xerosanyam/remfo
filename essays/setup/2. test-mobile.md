# Testing on mobile

to test on mobile, best is to use a tunneling service.
I use serveo because it allows custom domain

## Pre-step

```
ssh-keygen -f serveo -C ""
```

generate ssh key in current folder with name serveo, don't add any comment

## setup

follow custom domain settings - https://serveo.net/

## wait

- DNS propagation takes time.
  you will get "Warning: remote port forwarding failed"

## check, values should be similar to

CNAME - `local.remfo.app`
TXT - `_serveo-authkey.local.remfo.app`
