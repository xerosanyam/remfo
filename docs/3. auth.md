# Auth

For auth, we can rely on supabase's auth service.
It is basically a go server. Initially built by netlify - called GoTrue
It has implemented best practices, and we don't want to do what's already done.

## Working:

1. pass username, password to backend
2. validate. then pass to supabase service either via api call or supabase-js(wrapper over api)
3. auth service authenticates and replies back with jwt token
4. Apps store this token in localStorage/cookie and use it with subsequent requests
5. We can't access localStorage without JS & [also](https://www.rdegges.com/2018/please-stop-using-local-storage/)
6. Therefore we need to set token in cookie.

Services - supabase auth, clerk, auth0
Libraries - passportjs, lucia, authjs

## sessions

1. Traditional - sessionID based - stored in cookie - stateful (state is managed in DB) - degraded perf in non-serverless env because of lookup
2. JWT based - stored in localStorage - stateless - perfect for serverless env

## comparing passportjs, lucia, authjs

### lucia

- supports only cookie based sessions. (previously supported only jwt)

### passportjs

Proper email signup requires lot of items. Email verification, rate limiting, etc. So we will opt for OAuth.

## Steps to implement

1. implement lucia
2. implement hook (before/after)
3. implement db calls
4. make changes to lucia to accomodate oauth
5. add log in page
6. create authorization page
7. create callback page
8. create protected pages group
9. implement logout
10. implement logout form
