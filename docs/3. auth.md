# Auth

For auth, we can rely on supabase's auth service.
It is basically a go server. Initially built by netlify - called GoTrue
It has implemented best practices, and we don't want to do what's already done.

## Working:

1. pass username, password to backend
2. validate. then pass to supabase service either via api call or supabase-js(wrapper over api)
3. auth service authenticates and replies back with jwt token
4. Generally apps store this token in localStorage and use with subsequent requests
5. But there is a problem here - localStorage works only when JS is enabled
6. Therefore we need to set token in cookie. which requires ssr
