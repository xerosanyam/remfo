# Professional Email setup for Free

suppose, I want to setup hi@domain.com

## Receive email in your inbox

1. Go to domain registrar where you bought domain from (godaddy, bigrock, etc)
2. Setup email forwarding. (forward email to your gmail id). that's it.

## Sending/replying via hi@domain.com

1. go to gmail
2. Manage inbox settings
3. Accounts and Import
4. Send email as-> Add another email address
5. set name, email address(hi@domain.com), treat as alias - yes, next
6. smtp server - smtp.gmail.com, port-default, username- your gmail address, password - [your app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

### Domain comparisions

- porkbun supports 20 free forwards (hi@domain.com, hello@domain.com) etc.
- - it doesn't support wildcard/catch-all. (anything@remfo.com will get lost)
- ionos supports unlimited forwards and wildcard domains
- godaddy has made it chargeable (afaik)
