# Which stack

I played around with nextjs, nuxt, htmx. Svelte was the only framework, that let me buid web apps that could work without any js. I also did a perf test and found sveltekit great out of the box.

## HTMX

HTMX requires JS. HTMX requires backend to reply in a certain way (html)
HTML requires alpine for more User Interactivity

## Nextjs

Nextjs is react
