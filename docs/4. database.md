# Database

## how to connect to DB?
there are multiple ways, starting from base layer:
1. Direct Connection - has been removed in favor of connection pooling
2. Connection Pooling - uses supavisor (connection string, username, password)
	1. Transaction mode - for serverless; PORT - 6543
	2. Session mode - for long-lived connection; PORT - 5432
	
	in terms of how to connect to db, only change b/w 2 modes is PORT
	dependency - need to use an driver (like postgres.js)
	can't connect directly from frontend (can be both pro & con)

3. Data APIs - REST endpoints, generated by postgREST
	dependency - postgresREST extension

4. Use library like Supabase-js - wrapped over REST end points - but its syntax is like ORM
	dependency - postgresREST

5. ORMS (drizzle, prims) - they connect using connection pooling
	dependency - db driver

  

## Data APIs
### con:
- dependency over postgREST (your company might not allow extension)
- can't connect to tembo, neon because of dependency

### pros:
- can be called via fetch. simple.
- can be called directly by form.
- no need to write sql scripts
- looks very promising
