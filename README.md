# Remfo (Remember Forever) 🧠

Welcome to Remfo, a project aimed at helping you learn things more effectively and remember them forever! 🚀

## Project Overview ℹ️

Remfo, short for Remember Forever, is inspired by the concept of spaced repetition, similar to the popular tool Anki. Anki helps users transfer information from short-term memory to long-term memory through spaced repetition algorithms. While Anki offers many customizations and is free to use, the challenge lies in dedicating consistent time for revisions.

To address this challenge, we plan to publish Remfo as a Chrome extension apart from standalone web app.

## Features 🛠️

With Remfo, whenever you open a new page, you have two options:

A) **Add New Stuff**: Easily input new information that you'd like to remember for future revision sessions.

B) **Revise Old Stuff**: Quickly review previously saved content to reinforce your memory.

## Get Involved! 💻
